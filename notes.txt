setting up backend:
- have our dependencies outside of backend and frontend folders
- install express
- nodemon i -D nodemon concurrently    # dev dependendencies

- add these scripts
      "server": "nodemon backend/server",
      "client": "npm start --prefix frontend"
   - these can run one at a time
- run both at the same time:
      "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
install dotenv
- initialize in server.js
**REMINDER: keep .env in .gitignore

MONGODB SETUP:
- probably just watch https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/mern-e-commerce-from/9781801077545/9781801077545-video4_1/
- create database, in clusters make a new collection
- copy string for compass (program files/...) 
   and for application (in .env) 

- when you are in development with a backend server, 
   use proxy in package.json

   	"proxy": "http://127.0.0.1:5000",
